/// Opens a `.milashare` bundle, verifies it, previews what importing would
/// do — add a recording or replace the copy already here, and what happens
/// to each shared voice profile — and, once the user confirms, writes it
/// into the library. Mirrors `MilaConfigImporter`: `handleOpen(_:)` from the
/// file-open handler, a `PendingImport` that drives a `.sheet(item:)`, and
/// `confirm()` / `cancel()` from the sheet's buttons.
///
/// ## Trust boundary
///
/// A bundle is a zip somebody sent. The importer extracts it into a
/// throwaway directory and reads exactly three fixed entry names
/// (`ShareManifest`), checks each is a regular file inside that directory,
/// and verifies the audio's size and SHA-256 against the manifest. The
/// library filename is minted here from the title — nothing in the archive
/// names a file on this Mac.
///
/// ## Crash safety
///
/// Audio is copied to `<dest>.partial` first and renamed in the same
/// main-actor turn as the store write, so a crash mid-copy leaves an inert
/// file rather than a `.wav` that `RecordingStore.recoverOrphanRecordings`
/// would resurrect as a phantom "Recovered recording" on next launch. Stray
/// `.partial` files are swept at init.
